## Description

This project provides the *back-end HTTP server* of the system, which does the complicated processing.
It communicates with a *database server*, which records long term information for the back-end HTTP server.
When installed it would be accessed through an *HTTP reverse proxy* (also call the *ingress*),
which communicates with the browser.

The back-end HTTP server makes use of code in the *model* component.
The back-end HTTP server could run on one computer, or several.

The system has separate front-end and back-end HTTP servers because of the technical difficulty of combining them.
The front-end HTTP serving must provide identical static front-end code at multiple URLs,
because of the [Angular](https://angular.io/) *routing* of the front-end.
The back-end HTTP serving, by [Spring Boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot),
is more suitable for fixed routing of resources, with each resource having only one URL.

The build system makes the server available as a Debian installation package
(also suitable for Ubuntu, and other Debian derivatives),
and as a Docker images.
